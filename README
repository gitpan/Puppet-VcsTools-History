This package provides a GUI to draw on a Canvas a revision tree
extracted from the history log of any file archived with a VCS system
based on RCS.

This functionnality is available as a perl class
(Puppet::VcsTools::History) or as a script (viewHistory).

I'd like people who actually use this module for their application to
drop me a short note about what they're using this module for. 

Suggested DSLI line
Puppet::VcsTools::History bdpO  Vcs history viewer  DDUMONT
 
This module is in beta stage and was written with perl5.005. 

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in alpha state. Its interface may change (but
I hope not).
